# CONFIG_EXPERIMENT.yaml
# ============================================================
# This configuration file defines experiment-level behaviour:
#   - whether to introduce imbalance
#   - how to encode categorical and numerical variables
#   - how to handle missing values
#   - how to normalize features
#   - how to train and tune models
#
# All options listed below are directly compatible with TALENT’s
# preprocessing and training APIs.
# ============================================================

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Preprocessing settings
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Categorical encoding policy ---
# Determines how categorical variables are represented.
# Options supported by TALENT:
#   - "onehot"        → one-hot encoding
#   - "ordinal"       → integer encoding by category index
#   - "embedding"     → learned embeddings (for deep models)
#   - "indices"       → integer indices directly fed to the model
#   - "none"          → do not encode (model handles categories natively)
categorical_encoding: "ordinal"

# --- Numerical encoding policy ---
# Defines how numerical features are preprocessed before being fed to the model.
# Options supported by TALENT:
#   - "standard"      → z-score standardization
#   - "quantile"      → quantile transformation to uniform or normal distribution
#   - "power"         → power transformation (Box–Cox or Yeo–Johnson)
#   - "discretize"    → discretization into equal-width bins
#   - "Q_bins"        → quantile binning (TALENT’s custom option)
#   - "none"          → no numerical encoding applied
numerical_encoding: "quantile"

# --- Normalization ---
# Applies scaling to numeric features after encoding.
# Options supported by TALENT:
#   - "standard"      → (x - mean) / std
#   - "minmax"        → scale to [0, 1]
#   - "robust"        → scale using median and IQR (robust to outliers)
#   - "log"           → log transformation (for skewed features)
#   - "none"          → no normalization
normalization: "standard"

# --- Handling missing values ---
# TALENT handles missing data separately for numeric and categorical features.
#
# For numeric variables:
#   - "mean"          → replace NaN with mean value
#   - "median"        → replace NaN with median value
#   - "zero"          → replace NaN with 0
#   - "none"          → do not impute (keep as NaN)
#
# For categorical variables:
#   - "most_frequent" → replace NaN with mode
#   - "constant"      → replace NaN with a constant placeholder
#   - "none"          → no imputation
num_nan_policy: "mean"
cat_nan_policy: "most_frequent"

# Training and optimization settings

max_epochs: 100        # Maximum number of epochs for deep models
batch_size: 128        # Batch size for training (ignored by classical models)
tune: true             # Whether to perform hyperparameter tuning
n_trials: 50           # Number of tuning trials when tune = true
early_stopping: true   # Whether to use early stopping during training
early_stopping_patience: 10 # Patience epochs for early stopping
